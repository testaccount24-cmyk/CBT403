*                    TSO HELP FOR 'REVIEW' RELEASE 36.5     JULY 2002
)F Function -
  The REVIEW command allows a data set or UNIX entity to be examined at
  a 3270 TSO terminal in full screen mode.  Both disk and tape files
  may be REVIEWed.  If a PDS without a member is specified then a
  member selection list is displayed.  Load module members with a
  residence mode of ANY are shown in high intensity or red in the
  member list.  SCLM-managed members are flagged with an equals ('=')
  sign in the member list.  When looking at file data, a 'K' may be
  shown in the "ruler" heading line to denote the first and last, or
  only, column(s) of record keys.  On color terminals the portion of
  the "ruler" line corrsponding to record keys is shown in red.  If
  the record format indicates printer carriage control characters then
  an 'A' or an 'M' as appropriate may be shown in column 1 of the
  "ruler" heading line.

  REVIEW can format records according to Assembler data structure
  source code supplied by the user.  REVIEW can also format system
  related data such as SMF records, EREP data, VTOC entries, tape
  labels and load module structure and identification data.  REVIEW
  can format the directories of ZIP files created by PKZIP, Info-ZIP,
  WinZIP, etc.

  REVIEW can display the history of program objects residing in PDSE
  data sets or UNIX files, including compilation and program bind
  timestamps.

  REVIEW can display pictures in 1-bit (black-and-white), 4-bit
  (16 colors) and 8-bit (256 colors) single-plane ".PCX" (ZSoft
  Paintbrush) files on a terminal with 3270 graphics capabilities.

  REVIEW can process a single data set or a pre-allocated file
  concatenation.  Partitioned files can be sequentialized,
  offloaded in PDSLOAD (IEBUPDTE-like) format, or searched for
  specific or picture-masked data.  Load modules can be offloaded
  into a sequential format, and can be delinked into object decks.
  Sequential offload files can be processed to restore members
  into partitioned data sets.

  REVIEW can process the system PARMLIB concatenation.

  REVIEW can process UNIX files such as HFS (Hierarchical File System)
  files.

  REVIEW can operate as an ISPF dialog while processing OS data sets
  which are not partitioned.

  REVIEW allows access to, and the saving of, data by data content,
  data beyond I/O errors and end-of-file markers, and data from
  deleted members of a PDS.

  REVIEW can convert ASCII data to EBCDIC.

  REVIEW can be invoked recursively by using the TSO subcommand.
  Swapping between parallel sessions allows access to any nested
  REVIEW session without requiring the termination of any other
  REVIEW session.

  It is intended that the installation authorize 'REVVSAM' to allow the
  REVIEWing of VSAM components for problem diagnosis by programming
  support staff.  Normally, VSAM KSDS, ESDS, RRDS, VRRDS and LINEAR
  clusters, paths, alternate indices and their components can be
  REVIEWed without this authorization, with logical records being
  extracted from controlintervals for non-LINEAR organizations.  If a
  DB2 tablespace is REVIEWed, each row from a table in the tablespace
  will be presented as a logical record, independently from any DB2
  activity.

  The 'REVVSAM' command is intended to allow the browsing of physical
  VSAM components (ie. VSAM objects with VTOC entries) even with
  corrupt or missing data in a CATALOG, VVDS or CI control flags.
  APF authority is also required to REVIEW subsystem data sets.

  Required - 'dsname'
     or      'filename'  FILE
     or      'pathname'  which must begin with a slash
     or      no operands for "point and shoot".

  Defaults - TOP(0)
             UNIT(SYSALLDA) when VOLUME is specified.

  Aliases  - REV, REVVSAM
)O Operands -
)P 'dsname' or 'dsname(member)' - The data set to be examined.
   'filename' - The DDNAME allocated to the data set to be examined.
   'pathname' - The path name of an UNIX directory.

   If the first operand begins with a slash ('/') then it is deemed to
   specify an UNIX directory path, and no other operands are allowed.
   A specific UNIX file cannot be specified, but can be selected from
   a directory entry list display.

   If the first operand does not begin with a slash then it is assumed
   to be a DSNAME unless it is followed by the keyword 'FILE'.

   Specifying the quoted dsname of 'FORMAT4.DSCB' and a VOLUME
   requests that the VTOC of that volume be REVIEWed.

   Specifying the file name of PARMLIB when there is no PARMLIB
   allocated on a OS/390 1.2 or later system requests that the
   logical PARMLIB service be used to REVIEW the system PARMLIB
   concatenation.

   If no operands are supplied then REVIEW reads the screen image
   and extracts the data set name from the part of the screen
   containing the cursor.  This works in both fullscreen and line
   modes, but not under Session Manager which updates the screen
   before REVIEW receives control.  If a data set name is not found
   then normal TSO prompting is commenced except for a recursive
   REVIEW session where a message is displayed.

   ISPF users may like to load
       TSO REV) MODE(FSCR
   into a PF key for easy access to "point and shoot".  Similarly,
       TSO REV
   can be loaded into a REVIEW Program Function key.

   A member name is NOT considered part of the data set name for
   "point and shoot" purposes.

))FILE     - This keyword indicates that the first operand is
             a FILENAME, not a DSNAME.  This is useful for looking
             at a temporary data set or at concatenated libraries.
             A member name may be specified in the first operand
             after the DDNAME if the DDNAME is allocated to a
             PDS.  This allows you to enter 'REVIEW SYSPROC(X) F'
             to look at member 'X' in whatever PDS is allocated to
             DDNAME 'SYSPROC'.

             Note that REVIEWing a concatenated sequential file may
             cause unexpected behaviour.

             The 'FILE' operand may be abbreviated to 'F'.

))VOLUME('volume') - For uncataloged data sets, the volume serial.

             'VOLUME' may be abbreviated to 'V'.

))UNIT('unit') - For uncataloged data sets, the unit type.
             This operand is ignored if 'VOLUME' is not specified.
             If 'VOLUME' is specified the default unit is 'SYSALLDA'.
             For data sets accessed via the catalog, the unit is
             determined from the catalog entry.

             'UNIT' may be abbreviated to 'U'.

))TOP('rel-addr') - This specifies a relative address within the
             data set to be considered as the logical top-of-data.
             'TOP' performs the same function as the 'NEWTOP'
             subcommand before the initial display of data.  As with
             'NEWTOP', 'rel-addr' is a 1 to 6 hexadecimal digit
             number interpreted as a TTR for disk data sets, or as
             a BLOCK IDENTIFIER for tape data sets.  When 0 is
             specified or defaulted to, no special action is taken.
             This operand is ignored for VSAM and subsystem data sets.

             'TOP' may be abbreviated to 'T'.

))TTR('rel-addr') - Same as TOP('rel-addr').

))SUBSYS('subsys') - For subsystem data sets, this specifies the 1-4
             character subsystem name.  The subsystem must be active
             and allow data set allocation for this to be successful.
             The subsystem data set name specified may include a
             member name in parentheses if appropriate.
             This operand is ignored if 'VOLUME' is specified.

             'SUBSYS' may be abbreviated to 'S'.

))QUICK    - This indicates that if an unquoted data set name was
             specified then the name was fully qualified apart from
             the prefix (ie. no trailing qualifier has to be added).
             This saves a search of the catalog to look for trailing
             qualifiers which is otherwise performed unconditionally
             unless the 'VOLUME' operand was specified.  This operand
             is ignored if 'VOLUME' is specified.

             The 'QUICK' operand may be abbreviated to 'Q'.

))DATA     - This operand has several uses which, in general, mean
             that control data is displayed rather than interpreted.
             Specifically, this operand has seven (7) different
             functions depending upon the type of data set being
             REVIEWed.

             1) For a VSAM component -
                'DATA' indicates that control interval information
                and DB2 tablespace structure is not to be interpreted
                and that physical blocks are to be shown as-is without
                extracting logical records or rows.

             2) For a VSAM KSDS (Key-Sequenced Data Set) cluster -
                'DATA' indicates that records are to be presented in
                RBA (Relative Byte Address) or physical order rather
                than in key-sequence order.

             3) For a partitioned data set -
                'DATA' indicates that the PDS directory is to be
                REVIEWed as a sequential file, thereby precluding
                access to the contents of members.

             4) For other disk files with fixed length records -
                'DATA' indicates that direct access logic which can
                speed up access to different parts of the file will
                not be used.  This logic is employed by default when
                RECFM=F, RECFM=FS, or RECFM=FBS unless 'DATA' is
                specified.  It is also used when RECFM=FB and the
                VTOC indicates more than 256 tracks of data unless
                'DATA' is specified.
                (If this direct access logic is used and the file
                does not use standard blocking, incorrect line
                numbers and/or I/O errors could possibly occur.
                The 'NEWTOP' subcommand (without any operand)
                can be used from within REVIEW to make REVIEW
                start behaving as if 'DATA' had been specified.)

             5) For a SUBSYSTEM data set with a member included -
                'DATA' indicates that a sequential file will be
                allocated to the specified member only and data from
                other members will not be accessible.  Use the 'DATA'
                operand if the subsystem data set has members but the
                subsystem does not support partitioned access.
                (Normally, if 'DATA' was not specified then data from
                 the nominated member would initially be displayed,
                 but data from other members could subsequently
                 be displayed by using the 'MEMBER' subcommand.)

             6) For a ZIP file 'DATA' indicates that the ZIP directory
                will not be formatted, but that normal sequential read
                and display processing will take place.  Only DASD
                sequential files and UNIX files are checked for ZIP
                format by REVIEW.

             7) For a PCX (Paintbrush) file 'DATA' indicates that
                picture data is not to be interpreted, but that normal
                data display processing will take place.  Without the
                'DATA' operand REVIEW would attempt to display the
                picture image contained in 1-bit, 4-bit or 8-bit color
                single-plane PCX file.  (The 'FORMAT OFF' subcommand
                can be used from within REVIEW to instruct REVIEW to
                discard the picture data and therefore no longer show
                the picture image.  A subsequent 'NEWTOP' subcommand
                could be used to reactivate the image display.)  PCX
                files are recognised by data content when the first
                record is at least 80 bytes long.

             The 'DATA' operand may be abbreviated to 'D'.

))XISPMODE - This specifies that REVIEW
             1) is not to act as an ISPF application and is therefore
                to perform terminal I/O and subcommand processing
                natively; and
             2) is not to determine terminal capabilities from ISPF
                variables but is to issue a Read Partition (Query)
                itself if appropriate.

             This operand will only affect processing in an ISPF
             environment.  The first function listed above is only
             relevant to non-partitioned OS data sets (that is, it
             is not relevant to PDSs, PDSEs, and UNIX files because
             directory list processing in an ISPF application is
             not currently supported by REVIEW).

             The second function listed above relates to detecting
             the graphics capabilities of the TSO terminal.  If you
             want REVIEW to render graphic images (pictures) in an
             ISPF environment then the XISPMODE operand is required
             so that REVIEW will detect that the terminal can handle
             graphics.  Without this operand, REVIEW determines
             color, highlighting and graphics escape support from
             ISPF, does not perform terminal I/O for a Query, and
             can therefore present non-graphic file data more rapidly.

             The 'XISPMODE' operand may be abbreviated to 'X'.

))PFK      - This is not an operand, but a description of
             the Program Function Keys used by this command.
             PFK1  - HEL     PFK2  - SWAP LIST  PFK3  - END
             PFK4  - TSO     PFK5  - RFIND      PFK6  - FULL
             PFK7  - UP      PFK8  - DOWN       PFK9  - SWAP
             PFK10 - LEFT    PFK11 - RIGHT      PFK12 - RECALL
             PFK13 - TOP     PFK14 - BOTTOM     PFK15 - END
             PFK16 - SMF     PFK17 - RFIND      PFK18 - EREP
             PFK19 - UP      PFK20 - DOWN       PFK21 - HEX
             PFK22 - ASCII   PFK23 - TSO REV    PFK24 - RECALL
             These can be changed using the PFK# subcommand, but the
             changes are in effect only until the command ends unless
             a profile data set is allocated to DDNAME 'ISPPROF'.
             Example: 'PFK6 RIGHT 1' would make PFK6 'RIGHT 1'.
)S Subcommands -
 ----------- DIRECTORY ENTRY LIST MODE SUBCOMMANDS --------------------

   The following is a list of subcommands which can be entered in
   the directory entry list display primary input field marked by
   'LOCATE ==>'.  These subcommands will cause the action described,
   and will not be interpreted as an entry locate string.

  =CANCEL  - This subcommand instructs REVIEW to terminate.
             Any changes to your profile will be discarded.

  =DELINK  - (For PDS data sets only.  Not for UNIX files.)
             This subcommand instructs REVIEW to delink load modules
             and write object "decks" to the sequential file defined
             by the pre-allocated "SETFILE" value.  (See =SETFILE.)

             The subject PDS must have RECFM=U and must not be a PDSE.

             Only tagged members are delinked, unless there are no
             tagged members in which case ALL MEMBERS are delinked.

             REVIEW will attach the DELINKI program from CBT file 90
             to perform the delink function.  Fixed-length 80-byte
             records are written.  Note that SCATTER and OVERLAY
             programs will NOT be handled correctly.

             If the resultant object data is relinked, the new load
             modules may not be bit-for-bit copies of the original
             load modules, even though they should be functionally
             equivalent.  That is, reconstructed load modules may be
             reblocked and/or reordered.

  =EDITMEM - (For PDS and PDSE data sets only.  Not for UNIX files.)
             This subcommand instructs REVIEW to request a member
             name from the user which is to be edited using ISPF.
             This facility allows users to edit new members,
             although it can also be used to edit existing members.
             Once REVIEW receives this subcommand, it will request
             that the actual member name is typed in by the user in
             the primary input area.  Only the first PDS in a
             concatenation can be edited by this method.

  =HELP    - This subcommand instructs REVIEW to display help pages
             detailing subcommands and selection codes, with their
             abbreviations, available in the directory entry list
             display screen.

  =OFFLOAD - (For PDS and PDSE data sets only.  Not for UNIX files.)
             This subcommand instructs REVIEW to offload PDS members
             to the sequential file defined by the pre-allocated
             "SETFILE" value.  (See =SETFILE.)  Offloading can be
             performed for a partitioned data set or concatenation
             with ANY record format.

             The output RECFM will be overridden to FB or VB as
             appropriate.  The output LRECL will be overridden to
             the PDS LRECL or 80, whichever is greater.  If the PDS
             has an undefined record format then fixed-length
             80-byte records will be written.

             Members will be offloaded in member selection list
             order, and will be preceded by an IEBUPDTE-like
             './ ADD ' control statement.  IEBUPDTE-like './ ALIAS '
             statements are also generated only if the member list is
             sorted into TTR-order, and only for aliases whose
             corresponding real member is also offloaded.  Note that
             only the first occurrence of a given member name in a
             concatenation can be offloaded.

             OVERLAY programs cannot be offloaded by =OFFLOAD.

             Only tagged members are offloaded, unless there are no
             tagged members in which case ALL MEMBERS are offloaded.

             If the first two (2) data bytes of a record are './'
             then they will be translated to '><' on output.

  =PDSLOAD - (For PDS and PDSE data sets only.  Not for UNIX files.)
             This subcommand instructs REVIEW to process sequential
             input and load the data into members of the library
             being REVIEWed, which must not be a concatenation.

             The user is prompted with a panel to specify the data
             set containing the sequential input, whether ISPF
             statistics are to be generated, and an optional
             member name selection mask.

             The input is expected to be data created by =OFFLOAD
             or a compatible offload process.

             REVIEW will attach the PDSLOAD program from CBT file 93
             (or the REVLMOD program if the PDS RECFM=U) to perform
             the reload operation.

             Load modules reconstructed by this subcommand will be
             bit-for-bit copies of the original load modules.  No
             reblocking is performed for load modules.

             See PDSLOAD documentation for details on fixed- and
             variable-length record format combinations, and record
             truncation and extension actions.

  =REFRESH - This subcommand instructs REVIEW to update in-storage
             directory information with the latest data from disk.
             It will reset the tag status of all entries.

  =RESET   - This subcommand instructs REVIEW to untag all entries
             without re-reading entry list data from disk.

  =SEARCH  - This subcommand instructs REVIEW to search PDS or PDSE
             member contents, or UNIX file contents for specified data.
             When entered, the user will be presented with a data
             entry screen in which to specify the search type, the
             data to be searched for, an optional starting column
             where the data must reside, and, for PDS and PDSE data
             sets, a member name mask field which can be used to
             restrict the search to members with certain name
             patterns.

  =SEQLOAD - (For PDS and PDSE data sets only.  Not for UNIX files.)
             This subcommand instructs REVIEW to offload PDS members
             to the sequential file defined by the pre-allocated
             "SETFILE" value.  (See =SETFILE.)  Offloading can only
             be performed for fixed-length and variable-length record
             files.  The output RECFM will be overridden to FB or VB
             as appropriate.  The output LRECL will be overridden to
             the PDS LRECL.  Members will be offloaded in member
             selection list order.  Note that only the first
             occurrence of a given member name in a concatenation can
             be offloaded.

             If NO MEMBERS are tagged then ALL MEMBERS are offloaded.

      Note:  '=SEQLOAD' performs the same processing as '=OFFLOAD'
             except that no IEBUPDTE-like control statements are
             generated, './' is not translated on output, and the
             minimum output LRECL of 80 required by '=OFFLOAD' for
             IEBUPDTE compatibility is not required by '=SEQLOAD'.
             '=SEQLOAD' cannot process RECFM=U libraries.

  =SETFILE - (For PDS and PDSE data sets only.  Not for UNIX files.)
             This subcommand instructs REVIEW to request a file (DD)
             name from the user which may be used for output by the
             =DELINK, =OFFLOAD and =SEQLOAD subcommands which require
             a pre-allocated sequential output file.

             Once REVIEW receives this subcommand, it will request
             that the actual file (DD) name is typed in by the user
             in the primary input area.  The new value remains in
             effect only for the current REVIEW session.

             The default output DDname is SYSUT2.

  =TAGFLIP - This subcommand instructs REVIEW to toggle the tag status
             for every entry in the selection list.  Tagged entries
             will become untagged, while entries which were untagged
             will be tagged.

  =X       - This subcommand instructs REVIEW to terminate.  Use this
             subcommand if PFK3 on your terminal is broken, or if the
             PFK3 key sequence required by your 3270 emulation is too
             tedious to be bothered with.

 ----------- DIRECTORY ENTRY LIST MODE SELECTION CODES ----------------

   S       - Selection code for selecting an entry to be REVIEWed
             from a PDS or PDSE member list, or UNIX directory list.
             When an UNIX directory entry is selected REVIEW treats
             this as a navigation request, and replaces the displayed
             entries with entries from the selected directory.
             'S' is the default selection code, and is assumed
             when the cursor is placed on an entry selection input
             field but no character is typed.

   E       - Selection code for selecting an entry to be edited
             from a PDS or PDSE member list, or UNIX directory list.
             ISPF/PDF Edit is used.  This will only work if the
             file is acceptable to ISPF/PDF Edit and only in an
             ISPF environment.  This will not work if the 'REVIEW'
             command is issued from 'READY' mode.

   B       - Selection code for selecting an entry to be browsed
             from a PDS or PDSE member list, or UNIX directory list.
             ISPF/PDF Browse is used.  This will only work if the
             file is acceptable to ISPF/PDF Browse and only in an
             ISPF environment.  This will not work if the 'REVIEW'
             command is issued from 'READY' mode.

   T       - Selection code for tagging an entry for later processing.
             Tagged entries are shown in high intensity in the entry
             list.  For PDS and PDSE data sets, If any members are
             tagged, then only tagged members are processed during
             offload (see =OFFLOAD and =SEQLOAD), delink (see
             =DELINK) and search (see =SEARCH) operations.
             For UNIX files, if any files are tagged then only tagged
             files are processed during search operations.
             Further, tagging an entry may be useful for display
             control purposes when the entry list is large as
             PFK5/17 can be used to locate the next tagged entry.
             All tags can be cleared by =REFRESH and =RESET.

   R       - Selection code for resetting the tag status of an entry.
             All tags can be cleared by =REFRESH and =RESET.

   H       - Selection code for extracting and displaying the history
             of a program.

             For a load module (in a PDS) the normal display is merely
             scrolled right to show the first page of REVIEW's CESD
             formatting.  The formatted display of a CESD record can
             be up to fifteen (15) pages wide (one page width per
             symbol).  The formatted display of CESD blocks can also
             show data from IDR blocks.  The string '(go DOWN for
             data)' is shown when IDR data is not available and not
             all IDR blocks have been read.  To remedy this simply
             scroll down so that all IDR blocks are read and cached by
             REVIEW, then scroll up again to the desired CESD block.

             For a program object (in a PDSE or UNIX file) the Binder
             API is invoked to access IDR data which is then
             formatted and shown with one item per line.  The last
             display record will usually contain the program bind
             (link edit) IDR data, including the date and time of
             the bind.

   /       - Selection code for selecting an entry to be REVIEWed
             from a PDS or PDSE member list or UNIX directory list
             as if the DATA operand had been specified.  Normally,
             the DATA operand precludes access to PDS and PDSE member
             contents, and the DATA operand cannot be specified on
             an UNIX REVIEW request.  This selection code performs the
             same function as the 'S' selection code except that the
             DATA operand is deemed to have been specified.  This will
             prevent REVIEW from attempting to interpret data content
             such as pictures and ZIP file directories.  '/' and 'S'
             are identical when used to navigate the UNIX directory
             structure.

   A       - Selection code for selecting a UNIX file to be REVIEWed.
             This code instructs REVIEW to treat the file as an ASCII
             text file.  ASCII-to-EBCDIC translation is activated,
             and a new line is triggered by an ASCII LF character
             (x'0A') or an ASCII CRLF string (x'0D0A').  (EBCDIC text
             files employ the EBCDIC NL character (x'15') to trigger
             a new line.)

=FIND=F
)F   The FIND subcommand positions the screen to a text string.

  FIND notes:
   1.  A case insensitive search is performed.  That is, both
       upper and lower case characters can cause a match.
       To perform a case sensitive search use FINDCHR.
       To search for undisplayable data use FINDHEX.
       To search using picture mask characters use FINDPIC.
   2.  If no operand is entered, the previously used string is used.
   3.  Quotation marks are optional for the string unless it contains
       blank characters.
   4.  If any operands are specified the first must be the search
       string.  An unquoted asterisk means use the same string as
       previously.
   5.  A numeric second or third operand may be entered to specify
       a single starting column; otherwise all columns are searched.
   6.  A non-numeric second or third operand of 'FIRST', 'NEXT',
       'PREV', 'LAST', 'REST' or 'ALL' may be entered to indicate
       the search direction and starting location.
   7.  If currently in ASCII mode the string will be translated to
       ASCII.
   8.  The 'REST' and 'ALL' operands causes lines without the string
       to be excluded from view.  No place marker lines for this
       exclusion are shown.  This exclusion is cancelled by other
       FIND/FINDNOT commands, and by 'UP' (including 'UP MAX'),

       it will be translated to ASCII if currently in ASCII mode.
   2.  If no operand is entered, the previously used string is used.
   3.  Quotation marks are optional for the string unless it contains
       blank characters.
   4.  If any operands are specified the first must be the search
       string.  An unquoted asterisk means use the same string as
       previously.
   5.  A numeric second or third operand may be entered to specify
       a single starting column; otherwise all columns are searched.
   6.  A non-numeric second or third operand of 'FIRST', 'NEXT',

       the search direction and starting location.
   7.  The 'ALL' operand causes lines without the string to be
       excluded from view.  No place marker lines for this
       exclusion are shown.  This exclusion is cancelled by other
       FIND/FINDNOT commands, and by UP (including UP MAX), LIST,

=FINDPIC=FP
)F   The FINDPIC subcommand positions the screen to a data string.

  FINDPIC notes:
   1.  The search argument can contain mask characters which are
       interpreted as representing certain types of characters.
       Valid picture mask characters are:
         =  any character             .  invalid characters
         @  alphabetic characters     -  non-numeric characters
         #  numeric characters        <  lower case alphabetics
         $  special characters        >  upper case alphabetics
         ¬  non-blank characters
       Non-mask characters represent themselves, with matching of
       specific alphabetics being case insensitive.
   2.  The search argument is never translated to ASCII.
   3.  If no operand is entered, the previously used string is used.
   4.  Quotation marks are optional for the string unless it contains
       blank characters.
   5.  If any operands are specified the first must be the search
       string.  An unquoted asterisk means use the same string as
       previously.
   6.  A numeric second or third operand may be entered to specify
       a single starting column; otherwise all columns are searched.
   7.  A non-numeric second or third operand of 'FIRST', 'NEXT',
       'PREV', 'LAST', 'REST' or 'ALL' may be entered to indicate
       the search direction and starting location.
   8.  The 'REST' and 'ALL' operands cause lines without the string
       to be excluded from view.  No place marker lines for this
       exclusion are shown.  This exclusion is cancelled by other
       FIND/FINDNOT commands, and by 'UP' (including 'UP MAX'),
       'LIST', 'BOTTOM' and 'RESET'.  It is NOT cancelled by 'DOWN'
       or 'TOP', by 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' scrolling or by formatting
       subcommands.

=FINDSMF=FS
)F   The FINDSMF subcommand positions the screen to an SMF record
     of the requested type and optionally also subtype.  It is only
     of practical value when SMF data is being REVIEWed.

  FINDSMF notes:
   1.  The first or only search argument specifying the SMF record
       type must be a single unquoted decimal number between 0
       and 255 inclusive.
   2.  An optional second or third numeric operand is allowed.
       It is a second search argument specifying the SMF record
       subtype and must be a single unquoted decimal number
       between 0 and 255 inclusive.
   3.  Subtype searches for system records (0 to 127) are only
       allowed for record types known to have subtypes.  Subtype
       searches for user records (128 to 255) are allowed without
       validation.
   4.  No validity checking is performed on the specified subtype.
       Hence it is possible to search for a subtype which does not
       exist.
   5.  If no operand is entered, the previously used string is used.
   6.  A search will be performed even for non-SMF data.
   7.  Obviously a column operand is not applicable.
   8.  A non-numeric second or third operand of 'FIRST', 'NEXT',
       'PREV', 'LAST', 'REST' or 'ALL' may be entered to indicate
       the search direction and starting location.

=FHN=FXN
)F   The FXN subcommand positions the screen to a data string
  which does NOT match the search argument.

  FXN notes:
   1.  The search argument must be a even number of hexadecimal digits
       or a single unquoted asterisk.

=FPN
)F   The FPN subcommand positions the screen to a picture string
  which does NOT match the search argument.

  FPN notes:
   1.  The search argument can contain mask characters which are
       interpreted as representing certain types of characters.
       Valid picture mask characters are:
         =  any character             .  invalid characters
         @  alphabetic characters     -  non-numeric characters
         #  numeric characters        <  lower case alphabetics
         $  special characters        >  upper case alphabetics
         ¬  non-blank characters
       Non-mask characters represent themselves, with matching of
       specific alphabetics being case insensitive.
   2.  The search argument is never translated to ASCII.
   3.  If no operand is entered, the previously used string is used.
   4.  Quotation marks are optional for the string unless it contains
       blank characters.
   5.  If any operands are specified the first must be the search
       string.  An unquoted asterisk means use the same string as
       previously.

)F   The TOP subcommand moves the screen to the first line of the
  data set or member.  It differs from 'UP MAX' when line exclusion
  is active in that line exclusion is not cancelled.  In this case,
  TOP can be used to view the results of a "FIND ALL" search from
  the start without the need to reissue the "FIND ALL" command.

)O Operands - None.
=FULL
)F   The FULL subcommand specifies whether character data is displayed
  using full EBCDIC translation or only standard 3270 keyboard
  characters.  If turned on then only code-points that usually cause
  screen errors are deemed to be undisplayable.  If turned off then
  all characters not on a "standard" keyboard are deemed to be
  undisplayable.  (In character mode, undisplayable bytes are
  represented by a period ('.').)  Terminals with APL support may
  have normally unprintable characters displayed from the APL
  character set instead when in 'FULL OFF' mode, equivalent to one of
  the 3278A or the 3278T terminal display modes of ISPF, depending
  on the value set by the DISPLAY subcommand.
)X Syntax -
     FULL ON / OFF

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - opposite mode
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON       - Specifies that all code points X'40' to X'FE' and some
             below X'40' are displayable characters.
))OFF      - Specifies that only keyboard and possibly APL
             characters are displayable.
=DISPLAY=DISP
)F   The DISPLAY subcommand specifies whether character data shown
  in FULL OFF mode is TEXT EBCDIC (as per TN and T11 print trains)
  or not.  This subcommand can be used to improve the readability
  of the data being REVIEWed.  The current setting is shown in the
  message area of the top screen line after the KEYS subcommand is
  issued.  The DISPLAY setting is saved in the user profile data set.
)X Syntax -
     DISPLAY A / T

 Alias    - DISP
 Defaults - opposite mode
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))A        - Specifies that data code points are to be displayed
             from the standard character set if keyboard characters,
             or possibly from the graphic (APL) character set if not
             keyboard characters.  The graphic character set is not
             available on some terminals.  This mode is similar to
             the ISPF 3278A display mode.
))T        - Specifies that the "text" character set (similar to the
             TN and T11 print trains) is to be used for character
             code point interpretation.  Characters from the primary
             (standard) and alternate (graphic/APL) character sets
             may be used as appropriate in order to assist in data
             representation.  This mode is similar to the ISPF 3278T
             display mode, and is helpful in reading syntax diagrams.
=KEYS=?
)F   The KEYS subcommand displays the current Program Function Key
  values.  Each PF Key (1 to 24) has a default value which may
  be changed with the PFK command.
)X Syntax -
     KEYS

 Alias    - ?
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=ASCII
)F   The ASCII subcommand specifies whether character data is displayed
  using ASCII-to-EBCDIC translation or is to be treated as EBCDIC
  characters.  Only HEX-OFF displays are affected.  If turned on then
  system-supplied translation is carried out.  The internal bit
  patterns of previously entered FIND command strings are not altered,
  but FIND text strings entered while ASCII is turned on are translated
  to ASCII before search processing.  If turned on during CUTOFF or
  APPEND processing then output data will be translated from ASCII to
  EBCDIC before being written to the output file.
)X Syntax -

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - Opposite mode.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -

))OFF      - Specifies that the data is to be shown as-is in EBCDIC.
=RECALL
)F   The RECALL subcommand causes previously typed-in commands to be
  displayed in the primary input area where they may be changed if
  required and then reissued.  Note that single character input strings
  and text implied by PFK usage are not recallable.  The first command
  recalled is the most recently typed in command.  Consecutive RECALL
  commands cause increasingly older commands to be recalled.
)X Syntax -
     RECALL

 Alias    - The DUP character (X'1C').
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=PFK
)F   The PFK subcommand changes PFK definitions for the duration of
  the REVIEW session; to change a PFK, a subcommand such as
  'PFK6 RIGHT 1'  is entered to change PFK6 to 'RIGHT 1'.

  By default, the PF KEYS are defined as the following:
              PFK1  - HEL     PFK2  - SWAP LIST  PFK3  - END
              PFK4  - TSO     PFK5  - RFIND      PFK6  - FULL

)X Syntax -
     PFK## 'newpfdata'

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - nn and 'newpfdata'
)O Operands -
)P  ##      - Specifies the PF Key to be modified.
              ## is a 1 or 2 decimal digit number in the range of
              0 to 24 inclusive.  Numbers from 1 to 24 specify a
              particular Program Function Key.  If ## is 0 then
              all 24 PF Keys will be assigned their default values.

 'newpfdata'- Specifies the new subcommand for this PF Key.
=HEX
)F   The HEX subcommand specifies the display mode (character or
  hexadecimal) for data.  If HEX is entered without operands, the
  current HEX mode is switched to the opposite HEX mode.
)X Syntax -

)O Operands -
))ON       - Specifies that data should be displayed in HEX mode.
))OFF      - Specifies that data should be displayed in character mode.
=SMF
)F   The SMF subcommand specifies whether or not SMF records are
  to be converted to eye-readable summary format or not.  It is
  only of practical use if SMF records are being REVIEWed.  If SMF
  is entered without operands the current SMF mode is switched to
  the opposite SMF mode.  Note that activating SMF formatting
  deactivates EREP formatting.
)X Syntax -

=EREP
)F   The EREP subcommand specifies whether or not environmental
  records (originally from SYS1.LOGREC) are to be converted to
  eye-readable summary format or not.  It is only of practical
  use if LOGREC records are being REVIEWed.  If EREP is entered
  without operands the current EREP mode is switched to the
  opposite EREP mode.  Note that activating EREP formatting
  deactivates SMF formatting.
)X Syntax -
     EREP  ON / OFF

 Aliases  - None.

=FORMAT=FMT
)F   The FORMAT subcommand causes REVIEW to format file data on the
  screen according to the data structure and types specified in
  Assembler DS and/or DC statements.  The "ruler" heading line above
  the data is used to show the names of the visible data items, and
  where room permits the starting column number of the item is shown
  directly above the data item name.
     The format of the actual file data remains unchanged when HEX ON
  is active.  When HEX OFF is current, each data item is formatted
  according to the data type in the DS or DC statement.  The main data
  types are character, hexadecimal, decimal, and binary integer.
     The Assembler statements are read from the partitioned data set(s)
  allocated to the REVFMTS file.  REVFMTS must be allocated before it
  can be used by this subcommand.  The TSO subcommand may be useful in
  helping to perform this allocation from within REVIEW.  The FMTVAR
  subcommand can be used to override the data type of a specific data
  item or variable in a dynamic fashion.
     Note that for variable-length records, the record descriptor word
  (RDW) is assumed to be present in the data structure source, even
  though the contents of the RDW are not shown by REVIEW.
     When using this subcommand (as opposed to the SMF subcommand) to
  format SMF records, the following members of SYS1.MACLIB may be
  useful, especially after a FINDSMF ALL subcommand has been issued:
     IFASMFR  - type 0                   IAZSMF49 - type 49
     IFASMFR1 - type 7                   IFASMFR5 - type 50

               to be suspended.
=FMTVAR=FV
)F   The FMTVAR subcommand allows a user to override the data type
  of a data item or variable in a data structure previously read
  into memory by a FORMAT subcommand.  This is sometimes useful to
  enhance the viewability of some items.
)X Syntax -
     FMTVAR  'varname'  'type'

 Alias    - FV
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'varname' and 'type'
)O Operands -
)P 'varname' - Specifies the name of the data item or variable which
               is to have its data type specified.  Note that data
               items which have no name (because there was no label
               in the defining Assembler statement) cannot have their
               data type changed by this subcommand.
)P 'type'    - Specifies the data type which is to now be used to
               format the specified data item.  This operand must be
               a single character.  Valid types are:

               C - Characters.
                   Can be translated to EBCDIC when ASCII is ON.
                   Default for Assembler definition type C.

               Z - Zoned decimal.
                   Same as C but leading '0's are shown as blanks.
                   Default for Assembler definition type Z.

               X - Hexadecimal.
                   Each byte is shown as two hexadecimal digits.
                   Default for Assembler definition types
                   A, B, D, E, L, Q, S, V, X, and Y.

               P - Packed decimal.
                   Each byte is shown as two hexadecimal digits.
                   Leading zeros are shown as blanks.
                   If the last four bits of the item are a valid
                   packed decimal sign then it is shown as a
                   blank for hex A, C, E, and F to denote positive,
                   and as a '-' (minus sign) for hex B and D to
                   denote negative.
                   Default for Assembler definition type P.

               I - Signed binary integer.
                   The item is treated as a twos-complement binary
                   integer and converted to decimal for display.
                   A leading minus sign will be used when the first
                   bit of the item is a '1' indicating a negative
                   number.
                   The maximum length supported is four (4) bytes.
                   Default for Assembler definition types
                   F and H when two or four bytes long.

               U - Unsigned binary integer.
                   The item is treated as a non-negative binary
                   integer and converted to decimal for display.
                   The maximum length supported is four (4) bytes.
                   Default for Assembler definition types
                   F and H when one or three bytes long.
=COLOR=COLOUR
)F   The COLOR subcommand specifies whether or not data is to be
  displayed using 3270 extended highlighting and extended color,
  and which color is to be used for actual data display.  Colors
  for formatting mode, character mode and hexadecimal mode may be
  independently selected.  This command may cause errors on some
  terminals depending on terminal type and network definitions.
  If no operands are entered then the color mode is switched to
  the opposite mode.

  The data display colors may be saved in the profile data set.
)X Syntax -
     COLOR  ON / OFF / #

 Alias    - COLOUR
 Defaults - Opposite mode.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON      - Specifies that 3270 data stream extensions may be used.
            This may be rejected if the terminal is known to not
            support color or extended highlighting.
))OFF     - Specifies that 3270 data stream extensions may not be used.
))#       - Specifies the color to be used for actual data.

            If specified when formatting is active then this color is
            used when the record display is the result of formatting.

            Otherwise, when record formatting is OFF:
            If specified while in character mode then this color is
            used in character mode.  If specified while in hexadecimal
            mode then this color is used in hexadecimal mode.

            If specified while a picture image is being displayed, then
            a) the "white" pixels of a black-and-white image are shown
               in this color, or
            b) all non-black pixels of a color image displayed using
               programmed symbols are shown in this color unless the
               color number is 7 whereupon all colors are shown
               correctly, or
            c) the color number is used to control which color planes
               GDDM will be requested to display.
            The picture color is NOT saved in the profile data set,
            and defaults to 7 (neutral).

            # must be a single hexadecimal digit and may be rejected
            if it is known that the color is not supported by the
            terminal.  The possible colors and their codes are:
               1 - Blue                9 - Deep blue
               2 - Red                 A - Orange
               3 - Pink                B - Purple
               4 - Green               C - Pale green
               5 - Turquoise           D - Pale turquoise
               6 - Yellow              E - Grey
               7 - Neutral             F - White
                  (Codes 0 and 8 (Black) are not allowed.)
                  (Codes 9 to F are only for 16-color terminals.)
=SWAP
)F   The SWAP subcommand specifies which parallel REVIEW session
  is to become the current session.  It can also list the started
  REVIEW sessions which are eligible to become the current session.
  A parallel REVIEW session is created when the REVIEW TSO subcommand
  (not the ISPF TSO subcommand) is used to create a recursive REVIEW
  session.  The nesting order of these sessions can be changed by SWAP.
)X Syntax -
     SWAP   LIST / #

 Aliases  - None.
 Default  - 1
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))LIST    - Specifies that all parallel REVIEW sessions are to be
            listed in SWAP target session number order.
))#       - Specifies the decimal number of the target REVIEW session
            that is to be swapped with the current session.  The
            current session is always session 0, so the 'SWAP 0'
            subcommand is a no-operation.
=SUBMIT=SUB
)F   The SUBMIT subcommand invokes TSO SUBMIT for the file or member
  being REVIEWed.  This subcommand is invalid unless the file is
  sequential or partitioned, and has fixed length 80-byte records.
)X Syntax -
     SUBMIT

 Alias    - SUB
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=TSO=TSS
)F   The TSO subcommand specifies a TSO command processor to be
  invoked from the REVIEW processor.  CLISTs are not supported.
)X Syntax -
     TSO  'command' 'operands'

 Alias    - TSS
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'command'
)O Operands -
)P 'command'  - Specifies a TSO command to be executed.

)P 'operands' - Specifies any desired operands for this TSO command.
=LIST=L=LOC=LOCATE
)F   The LIST subcommand repositions the screen to the relative line
  number entered.
)X Syntax -
     LIST 'lineno'

 Aliases  - L, LOC, LOCATE
 Defaults - None.
 Required - lineno
)O Operands -
)P 'lineno' -  Specifies the relative line number to which the screen
               is to be positioned.
=NEWTOP
)F   The NEWTOP command allows the specification of an arbitrary
  relative physical address to be considered as the top-of-data.
  This is useful for viewing data beyond I/O errors and end-of-file
  markers that would normally be encountered, for viewing the
  contents of deleted PDS members, and for resynchronizing the
  REVIEW session with a file that is currently being updated.
  It is also useful for directly viewing data a long way from the
  start of the file without reading all the preceding records.
)X Syntax -
     NEWTOP 'rel-addr'

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - 0
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'rel-addr' - a 1 to 6 hexadecimal digit number specifying a
     relative physical address.  For disk files this specifies a
     relative TTR.  For tape files this specifies a relative block
     number.  A value of zero specifies that the real top-of-data
     address is to be used and previously acquired end-of-file and
     record location information is to be dropped.
  ** Note that 0 is the only operand allowed when viewing VSAM
     files, and in this case NEWTOP merely performs a CLOSE
     followed by an OPEN to drop all pre-loaded buffers.
  ** Also note that the subcommand sequence
            HEX ON
            RIGHT MAX
            HEX OFF
     can be used to display the relative physical address of each
     logical record in NEWTOP operand format.  For spanned records
     the address of the last segment is shown.
=APPEND=ADD=TACKON
)F   The APPEND subcommand causes REVIEW to write records from the
  data being REVIEWed to an output file.  Records are written
  consecutively from the first record shown on the screen until
  the requested number of records has been copied or end-of-file is
  reached.  When complete, the first record AFTER the copied records
  is made the new top-of-screen record.  The APPEND subcommand
  performs the same processing as the COPYOUT subcommand except that
  the output file is opened for EXTEND, so that data is appended to
  any data already residing in the output file.  Obviously, APPEND
  and COPYOUT become identical when output is directed to SYSOUT or
  the user's terminal.
     A major advantage that the COPYOUT and APPEND subcommands provide
  is the ability to copy data that has been rendered inaccessible by
  I/O errors.  Data beyond an I/O error can be REVIEWed with the use
  of the NEWTOP subcommand.  Any data that can be REVIEWed can be
  copied and saved to an intermediate file for data reclamation.
     Another feature of COPYOUT and APPEND is selectivity.  Not only
  can records be selected by manually scrolling to a specific record
  and cutting a specific number of records, but selectivity can be
  automated with FIND ALL and FINDNOT ALL.  Only records eligible
  for display can be copied, so FIND ALL and FINDNOT ALL subcommands
  can be used to exclude records based on their data content not
  only from display but also from offloading by COPYOUT and APPEND.
     Further, data copied from an ASCII file can be converted to EBCDIC
  by specifying ASCII ON before commencing the COPYOUT operation.
)X Syntax -
     APPEND 'filename' 'record-count'

 Aliases  - ADD, TACKON
 Defaults - SYSUT2, copy to end-of-file.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'filename' - Specifies the DDNAME of the output file.  The output
                file must be pre-allocated.  SYSUT2 is the default
                DDNAME, even if overridden on a previous APPEND.
                If the output file is not SYSUT2, then 'filename'
                MUST be specified.
)P 'record-count'
              - Specifies the number of records to be copied.
                If not specified then data is copied until end-of-file
                is reached or forced by an I/O error.
=COPYOUT=CUTOFF=CUT=CUTOVER
)F   The COPYOUT subcommand causes REVIEW to write records from the
  data being REVIEWed to an output file.  Records are written
  consecutively from the first record shown on the screen until
  the requested number of records has been copied or end-of-file is
  reached.  When complete, the first record AFTER the copied records
  is made the new top-of-screen record.  The COPYOUT subcommand
  performs the same processing as the APPEND subcommand except that
  the output file is opened for OUTPUT, so that data already residing
  in the output file is overwritten and lost.  Obviously, COPYOUT
  and APPEND become identical when output is directed to SYSOUT or
  the user's terminal.
     A major advantage that the COPYOUT and APPEND subcommands provide
  is the ability to copy data that has been rendered inaccessible by
  I/O errors.  Data beyond an I/O error can be REVIEWed with the use
  of the NEWTOP subcommand.  Any data that can be REVIEWed can be
  copied and saved to an intermediate file for data reclamation.

     COPYOUT 'filename' 'record-count'

 Aliases  - CUTOFF, CUT, CUTOVER
 Defaults - SYSUT2, copy to end-of-file.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'filename' - Specifies the DDNAME of the output file.  The output
                file must be pre-allocated.  SYSUT2 is the default
                DDNAME, even if overridden on a previous CUTOFF.
                If the output file is not SYSUT2, then 'filename'
                MUST be specified.
)P 'record-count'
              - Specifies the number of records to be copied.
                If not specified then data is copied until end-of-file
                is reached or forced by an I/O error.
=PICDATA
)F   The PICDATA subcommand causes REVIEW to write fixed-length
  80-byte records to the specified file.  The records are Assembler
  source statements containing data necessary to recreate the image
  which is currently being displayed by REVIEW.
     This subcommand is only valid when REVIEW can display the image
  contained in a picture file.  Its use provides a mechanism for
  exporting an image into other application source code.
     If REVIEW is displaying the picture with programmed symbols,
  the file will contain the data necessary to load the symbols
  (18 bytes per format type-1 symbol) plus data regarding symbol
  placement in the picture.
     If REVIEW issues calls to GDDM to display the picture, the
  data will contain the bitmaps passed to GDDM via GSIMG calls.
     Data for blue, red and green planes will be written for color
  images, whereas only one plane is used for black-and-white images.
)X Syntax -
     PICDATA 'filename'

 Aliases  - None.

 Required - 'filename'
)O Operands -
)P 'filename' - Specifies the DDNAME of the output file.  Fixed-length
                80-byte records will be written to this file.  This
                operand must be specified.
=BROWSE
)F   The BROWSE subcommand requests ISPF to BROWSE the data set or
  member currently being REVIEWed.  This subcommand is only valid
  when the current data set is an MVS DASD data set.  It is not
  valid for an UNIX file or a data set being treated as a ZIP file.
  The ISPF request will only succeed in an ISPF environment.

)X Syntax -

=EDIT
)F   The EDIT subcommand requests ISPF to EDIT the data set or
  member currently being REVIEWed.  This subcommand is only valid
  when the current data set is an MVS DASD data set.  It is not
  valid for an UNIX file or a data set being treated as a ZIP file.
  The ISPF request will only succeed in an ISPF environment.

)X Syntax -

)O Operands - None.
=CANCEL=CAN
)F   The CANCEL subcommand performs the same processing as the END
  subcommand without saving the REVIEW/HEL user profile to disk.  The
  REVIEW/HEL user profile (which contains data display colors,
  scrolling amount and 24 PF Key values) is normally only rewritten to
  disk at the END of a REVIEW session if it has been changed during
  that session.  If a member list has not been displayed in a session
  then the REVIEW session is terminated without saving the user
  profile.  If a member list has been shown it is reshown but the user
  profile is no longer considered to have been altered, even though the
  profile "in-core" still has the changes applied to it.  Changing the
  profile at this stage and exiting will cause all accumulated profile
  changes for the REVIEW session to be saved to disk unless another
  CANCEL is issued.
