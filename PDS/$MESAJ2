Hi Sam,

1. Under IBM Bookmanager you must first unload the messages to a
flat file tab to ACTION BAR ----> FUNCTION -----> COPY ----->
select from_section to_section

for example  the ARC* Messages from_section = 2.1 to_section = 2.1289

2. With the JCL (ARCUNJCL for ARC**** messages) and the REXX exec
(member ARCUNLOD for the ARC**** messages), you can create
the pds members for the messages

3. The process is as follows:  Once you create the flat file
containing all the ARC**** messages from the Bookmanager system,
you run the ARCUNLOD REXX to put (IEBUPDTE or PDSLOAD (CBT FIle 093))
./ ADD NAME=msgnumbr   cards in front of each particular message in
the flat file.  In our example, the resulting file (still a flat
file) is called 'userid.ARC.OFF', which was created from the file
'userid.ARC.MSGS' that was produced by Bookmanager.  Then, in another
(TSO-in-batch) step, in member ARCUNJCL, you run the PDSLOAD program,
and creates the pds:  'userid.ARC.MSGS.PDS', whose members you can
then copy into the 'userid.MESAJ.PDS'.

The PDSLOAD program source is in CBT Tape File 093--load modules are
in File 035, and all you have to do is to copy the load module into
your load library, and use it.

4. The way I have set up this package on my system, I only have used
the ADR**** (from DFDSS - PGM=ADRDSSU) message, the ARC**** (from HSM)
messages, and the IDC**** (from IDCAMS) messages.  Between these three
sets of messages only, there are over 2800 members in my MESAJ.PDS .
I have included separate sets of JCL to get each type of message group
for myself.  But you can do this for any sets of messages that you
want.  Just make sure that your MESAJ.PDS has enough space, and enough
directory blocks.
